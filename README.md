- [Hex package](https://hex.pm/packages/owoify_gleam)

This is a Gleam port of [mohan-cao's owoify-js](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js), which will help you turn any string into nonsensical babyspeak similar to LeafySweet's infamous Chrome extension.

Just like my other Owoify ports, three levels of owoness are available:

1. **owo (default):** The most vanilla one.
2. **uwu:** The moderate one.
3. **uvu:** Litewawwy unweadabwal.

Please refer to the [original owoify-js](https://github.com/mohan-cao/owoify-js) repository for more information.

Right now Gleam's stdlib doesn't have a comprehensive regular expression support. Thankfully, Gleam has wonderful support for Erlang FFI. Therefore, currently this library is just a thin wrapper of my [owoify_erl](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify_erl). 

# Reason for development

Even though Gleam's Erlang FFI support is excellent, calling functions written in Erlang still requires you manually write external functions, which can be painstaking depending on how many external functions you want to call. Therefore, [owoify_gleam](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify_gleam) is just a thin wrapper of my [owoify_erl](https://github.com/deadshot465/owoify_erl) that does exactly that for you.

Also Gleam is cool! ðŸ˜Œ

# Installation

```sh
gleam add owoify_gleam
```

# Usage

```gleam
import gleam/io
import owoify_gleam

pub fn main() {
  owoify_gleam.owoify("This is the string to owo! Kinda cute isn't it?")
  |> io.println()

  owoify_gleam.owoify_with_level("This is the string to owo! Kinda cute isn't it?", owoify_gleam.Uvu)
  |> io.println()
}

// Possible output
// This is teh stwing two owo! Kinda cute isn't it?
// fwis is teh stwing two owowowouwu Kinda cute isn't it?
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/owoify_gleam>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```
